# Process Flow

## 1. System Introduction
**NFT Card Trading System**: Uses Hardhat to deploy smart contracts, integrates with MetaMask wallet on the front-end, and conducts user authentication and transactions. The system determines whether the connected account is a seller or a buyer and directs them to the corresponding functional area.

## 2. Connect Wallet

After logging into the MetaMask extension, the user clicks the **Connect Wallet** button. When the screen displays **Connected to Wallet: Wallet Address**, it indicates that the connection is successful.

Private Key: 0xde9be858da4a475276426320d5e9262ecfc3ba460bfac56360bfa6c4c28b4ee0

Store(Company)
Account #19: 0x8626f6940E2eb28930eFb4CeF49B2d1F2C9C1199 (10000 ETH)
Private Key: 0xdf57089febbacf7ba0bc227dafbffa9fc08a93fdc68e1e42411a14efcf23656e

## step 2
```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
npx hardhat node #相當於 avail 的功能，執行在另外的 terminal
（如果出現 permission deny 則執行 rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json 然後重新執行） 
npx hardhat compile #先 compile (如果出現錯誤或是修改功能後要重新生成合約，可以先執行 npx hardhat clean)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost #部署合約
```
會出現：

🚀 使用帳號部署: 0x8626f6940E2eb28930eFb4CeF49B2d1F2C9C1199 

這個可以在 `hardhat.config.js module.exports`修改你希望的合約擁有者

📦 合約部署成功於: 0x5095d3313C76E8d29163e40a0223A5816a8037D8
